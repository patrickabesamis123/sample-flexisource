If you follow one of these pages and form part of the Employer Member's profile page, you form part of that profile page's "Community". Non-identifiable information about you will be provided to the profile page's administrator.</p>
                                           <p>Certain profile pages on the Service are public (such as the Employer Member pages).

This is different to saving a Role Publication on a watch list in your profile.</p>

                                           <p>When you follow an Employer Member, that Employer Member may elect to search for skills amongst its Community for an upcoming Role. You will be notified if you have the skills that match the upcoming Role but you will not be personally identified.</p>
